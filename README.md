# My Xmonad configuration

This is my configuration of the awesome tiling window manager
[Xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) written in Haskell. Some of the features are:

- Support for a tree-column layout
- smartBorders: the borders are automatically hidden when there is only one
  window
- M-a displays the current time on top using `dzen2`
- M-p launches `dmenu`
- S-M-a kills the current window
- M-<Insert> mutes the sound
- M-<PageUp> increases the volume
- M-<PageDown> decreases the volume
- M-z/x/c/v/b switch between the first 5 workspace (easier to press then 1-5)
- S-M-F10 locks the screen using `slock`
- S-M-F11 reboots the system
- S-M-F12 shuts down the system

Enjoy! :)
